# Sykloc - Unity Game

## Game Description

Welcome to Sykloc, a simple and addictive Unity game where your goal is to survive as long as possible by shooting down waves of enemies with your trusty circle-shaped player character.

In this game, you control a circular player character that can shoot bullets continuously. Enemies will randomly spawn on the screen at regular intervals, and your task is to move and eliminate them with your bullets. You start with 100 health points, and if your health reaches zero, the game ends. Your objective is to achieve the highest score by defeating as many enemies as you can before your health runs out.

Sykloc is designed for quick and exciting gameplay sessions, making it perfect for players of all ages.
